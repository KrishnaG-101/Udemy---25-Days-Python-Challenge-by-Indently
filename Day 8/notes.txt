Error-Handling in python:

You cannot assume users to know how to use your program, user's interactions with our program is unpredictable.

Syntax Error cannot be handled.

We can use try and except block to handle and print errors.

We can handle multiple errors at once by putting the error classes in a tuple when specifying in except.

Finally is used to run a block of code regardless of whether the previous code runs or throws an error. It can be used with or wihout try and except.

We use raise keyword to raise particular or even custom errors using Error classes or Exception function.

We can use Generic Exception handling techniques to get information about the errors during development or getting logs when the application is live.
