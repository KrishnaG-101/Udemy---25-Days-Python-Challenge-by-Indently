Methods are functions defined inside a class, functions and methods are essentially the same otherwise.

Static Methods, defined using @staticmethod decorator are methods inside the class that do not depend on an instance, i.e. do not use self as variable at all inside the body.
With @staticmethod decorator we can create a method that does not take the self parameter.
Static Methods can be called using both the class itself and its instances.

Class Methods, defined using @classmethod decorator are methods that effect the class directly, these take the cls parameter instead of self.
Class Methods run on the class directly so these can only be called using the class name itsef. e.g. Car.change_year().
We can use class methods for a lot of purposes: to access and modify class variables, create factory methods, or do anything on a class level.
Factory Method technique: using class methods to create alternative constructors. Returns an instance of the class.
