Async IO: Async IO is a built-in library that allows us to write Asynchronous code & programs in python.
          Async IO allows our programs to handle multiple tasks at once, without waiting for one task to finish to start the next.
          It is useful to make our programs more efficient specially when dealing with tasks that spend a lot of time waiting.
          It is different from multi-threading and multi-programming or parallel processing.
          Syntax includes: import asyncio  async def func()...  await asyncio.sleep()  await asyncio.gather()  asyncio.run(func), etc.

Asynchronous Function: To mark a function as asynchronous, we just need to put "async" keyword in front of the function definition.
                       e.g. async def func(<arguments>) -> <return_type>:...

Await: await keyword is used to tell python to wait for completion of a particular line of code before moving on to the next line inside the function.
       It is usually placed in front of the code without which we cannot proceed inside the function, e.g. downloading, getting API response, etc.
       e.g. await asyncio.sleep(2)

Task: Task is a class present in the asyncio module, which can be used to create asynchronous tasks inside our code.
      We use it with asyncio.create_task() function, this function returns an object of class Task.
      e.g. cat_task : Task[<return_type>] = asyncio.create_task(...)
      We can assign the result from this task to a variable like this: cat_result : str = await cat_task
      Task is used to complete multiple tasks at the same time and when the tasks are completed, we can assign the results to a variables.
      We can also set timeouts on tasks by using the async.wait_for(task, timeout) function which will raise a TimeoutError if a task is not completed within a given period of time.
      We can execute code lines in between the Task creation and result assignment, as the tasks may take time to complete, and we want some code to execute in between.

asyncio.create_task(): returns a Task object, the task is started as soon as it is initiated, however result can only be assigned after completion, hence we use await for that.

asyncio.wait_for(): It takes two arguments, the first one is the task and the second is a timeout.
                    e.g. cat_result : str = await asyncio.wait_for(cat_task, 5), this will raise an error if the cat_task is not completed and the result is not assigned to cat_result within 5 seconds.

asyncio.run(): It is used to run an asynchronous program, (we don't use this inside functions but in the global scope)*

asyncio.gather(): asyncio.gather() function is used to complete multiple tasks instead of creating tasks individually and getting results, we start multiple tasks at once and get results in a list.
                  We can also use a return_exceptions=True argument to complete the tasks regardless of an error in one or many of them, it will just return the exception itself for the tasks failed.
                  e.g. results = await asyncio.gather(download(...), download(...), ...) or tasks = [download(...)...]  results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
