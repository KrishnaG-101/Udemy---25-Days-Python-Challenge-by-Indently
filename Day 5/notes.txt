Control Flow commands are used to determine the order of execution of lines of code.

If - else short-hand can be used but make sure to not compromise the readability of the code.

Use _ instead of a variable or i, if we are looping over without the use of the iterator value.

Break and Continue are powerful keywords which can be used to change the control flow of our program.

An 'else' statement can be used with both For loop and While loop to execute a statement if the loop finishes without any interruption. It can also be used to run statement if the loop was never entered.
