Type annotations with collection types are declared like this list[str | int], dict[str | float] or tuple[int, int] (ordered and one for one)

Key bindings makes programming fast. (e.g. "ctrl + [" will remove indent from the line, "ctrl + ]" will add indent to the line, etc.)

Type annotations also allow ellipsis i.e. tuple[int, ...] will indicate a lot of int values in the tuple.

Tuples can be declared like this a = 1, 2 or a = (1, 2), both will result the same.

True and 1, False and 0 are considered duplicates inside a set.

Every collection data types has many different methods to work with specially sets, use or read documentation whenever required.

There are many different operators in python as well including walrus (:=), pipe (|), etc. each with its different functionalities.

Major built in collections in python include lists, tuples, sets, frozensets, dictionaries. Additional collections can be found in collections library.
