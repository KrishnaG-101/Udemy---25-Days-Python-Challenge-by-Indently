A lot of languages require a main entry point for their program, although python doesn't require a main entry point, it is recommended to create a main function to remove the variables from the global scope and avoiding shadow access problem.

List comprehension technique allows for creation of a list or collection using simple one line syntax of for loop that can be combined with one liner conditionals.
e.g. text = "Normal String", vowels = [vowel for vowel in text if vowel in "aeiouAEIOU"]

Slicing is another great technique for accessing items from a sequence. syntax collection[start : end : skip], we can even use negative indices or negative skip values for reversing.

Looping through and modifying the same data at the same time can introduce problems and bugs, that's why avoid looping and modifying at the same time.
If can't be avoided then use a copy of the data using .copy() function or create a new collection and append while looping.
Be careful modifying the original data while iterating over it, because it can create bugs which will be hard to find and debug.
