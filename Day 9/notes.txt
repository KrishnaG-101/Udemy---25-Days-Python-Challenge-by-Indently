Modules are essentially python files (.py), these help organize code as we can divide files (code) based on functionality.

We use the . notation to access functionality inside a module, similarly we do that with sub-modules, classes, sub-classes and functions.

import, from, as, *, __name__ == "__main__", pip, pip commands.

Creating and importing a module will also run all its code in the imported file, to avoid that put the code inside if __name__ == "__main__" block to ensure its execution only on running the file at hand.

Only install packages and code from trusted sources, beware of malicious code and vulnerabilities.
