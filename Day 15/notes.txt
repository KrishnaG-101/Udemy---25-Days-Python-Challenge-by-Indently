Inheritance allows us to inherit behavior and functionalities from one class to another, allowing us to create subclasses and represent complex relationships in our code.
We inherit from one class to another using brackets in from of our class name. e.g. class Cat(Mammal):
Instance of child class can call method of parent class if allowed.

The super() function is used to call methods or get variables of a parents class inside the implementation of the child class. A lot of that can also be done using self.
We use super().__init__() inside the implementation of child class as we have to initialize the parent class as well in the child __init__().

Name Mangling allows us to create variables and methods in the class that we don't want to be shadowed in child classes.
We just have to add double underscores before the variable or method name. e.g. self.__balance will create one.
Under the hood the variable self.__balance is converted to self._[Class_Name]__balance variable.
It can also be used a method to create private variables and methods (cannot be used outside the class).

We can use UUID class for creating a unique id for our object, we can use this inside out class implementation to give our objects unique ids which will help during their comparison.
Always create private variables and methods for implementing functionalities that you do not want user to interact with directly.
We use getters and setters to interact with an instance's variables, and do not access or update them directly.

@abstractmethod
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
Abstract Base Classes (ABC) and abstract methods are used to create classes and methods which are only to be used as a template for creating other classes and to ensure implementation.
These are only used for guiding creation of child classes, and cannot be instanciated directly as these do not need an __init__() method.
When we inherit from an ABC (Abstract Base Class) we have to implement the @abstractmethods with the correct signature (recommended), otherwise code will throw an error.

...(elipces) and pass work very similarly, however we use pass to skip something delibrately, and ...(elipces) as a temprory place holder. However these can use interchangably as well.
