Type hints or Type Annotations are completely optional in python, but they make the code more readable and easy to debug.

Primitive data types in python: str, int, float, complex, bool, and None
Collection data types in python: list, tuple, set, frozenset and dict
The collections library in python has additional collection data types available for use.

Underscores can be added to numbers (int and float) like this 1_000_000_000 to make them more readable.

Floats calculations are not precise and can cause unexpected results when comparing float, so it is advised to round off.

Strings can be concatinated without the + operator, like this 'abcd' 'efgh' -> 'abcdefgh', this is called implicit string concatination.

Bool: 1 == True -> True and 0 == False -> True, also True + True -> 2, python converts 1 to True and 0 to False for convenience.

Type conversion in python is very flexible, just make sure that the conversion makes sense.
